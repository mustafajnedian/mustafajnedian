### Brief description of Private Repos on my GitHub Repository.  

##  Private Portfolio Projects

# AI/ML & Distributed Microservices Architecture
- Passionate about building AI-powered, cloud-native financial platforms that are scalable, secure, and data-driven.
- I specialize in designing and implementing scalable, distributed systems with a strong focus on AI-driven analytics, real-time processing, and financial technology.
- My recent work includes re-architecting a Fintech platform using a microservices-based architecture powered by Apache Kafka, Redis, MySQL, and MongoDB, deployed on Kubernetes for high availability and auto-scaling.
- The system was initially developed in 2023/2024 using a monolithic approach but has now been rearchitected into a fully distributed microservices-based architecture, with AI/ML and Kubernestes based scalability.
  
## Key Areas of Expertise:
- AI/ML-Driven Analytics – Built a Fraud Detection System leveraging machine learning models for anomaly detection in financial transactions.
- Event-Driven Microservices – Designed a Kafka-based architecture for asynchronous processing, ensuring system resilience.
- Transactional Integrity (ACID) – Implemented SAGA patterns, 2PC, and Redis-based idempotency for consistent financial operations.
- Real-Time Data Processing – Engineered streaming analytics pipelines using Kafka Streams & Redis caching for ultra-low latency insights.
- Scalable Cloud Deployment – Architected a Kubernetes-native infrastructure, leveraging Istio, Prometheus, and Grafana for observability and auto-scaling.

## Tech Stack: 
- Python, FastAPI, Java (Spring Boot), Kafka, Redis, MongoDB, MySQL, Kubernetes, TensorFlow, PyTorch
